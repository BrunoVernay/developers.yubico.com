== Getting Started with Android

Our new Android SDK, YubiKit for Android, provides native support for WebAuthn. Yubico offers two great user experiences on Android employing a simple tap for NFC or a physical connection with USB.

*Authentication via NFC* is supported by the link:https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5-nfc[YubiKey 5 NFC].

*Authentication via physical connection* is supported by the NFC keys named above and all of the other YubiKeys with the USB connector (see the link:https://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000006476-yubikey-support-on-android[YubiKey support on Android article] for a list of these.

This multi-module library provides APIs to interact with the following features of YubiKeys and Security Keys by Yubico:

* The link:https://github.com/Yubico/yubikit-android/blob/master/yubikit/README.md[YubiKit module] is the core library that detects the plugged in key or one in close proximity to the NFC antenna.

* link:https://github.com/Yubico/yubikit-android/blob/master/oath/README.md[OATH] - Allows applications such as an authenticator app to store link:https://developers.yubico.com/OATH/[OATH TOTP and HOTP secrets] on a YubiKey and generate one-time passwords.

* link:https://github.com/Yubico/yubikit-android/blob/master/otp/README.md[OTP] - Provides implementation classes to obtain link:https://developers.yubico.com/OTP/[Yubico OTPs] via USB or NFC.

* link:https://github.com/Yubico/yubikit-android/blob/master/piv/README.md[PIV] - Provides an implementation of the Personal Identity Verification (link:https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/[PIV]) interface.

* link:https://github.com/Yubico/yubikit-android/blob/master/management/README.md[MGMT] - Provides YubiKey management functionality, a subset of the API for personal customization of the YubiKey and the HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response.

In addition, the library includes a demo application implemented in Kotlin, the link:https://github.com/Yubico/yubikit-android/tree/master/YubikitDemo[YubiKit Demo App], which provides a complete example of integrating and using all the features of the library in an Android project.


[NOTE]
======
The pre-release version of the YubiKit Android SDK supported a subset of FIDO2 functionality. In this general availability (GA) version, that FIDO2 module has been removed. We recommend developers use the official link:https://developers.google.com/identity/fido/android/native-apps[FIDO2 API for Android] provided by Google.
